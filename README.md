## Description
This is the first videogame that I coded, I want it to be somekind of RPG.       
One day it should have implemented Mana, HP, Monsters, Npcs and much more, currently only movement is implemented.       
This project is entirely coded in Java using the Swing library.

## Usage
1. Download the code
2. Open an IDE(I use eclipse) and import the project
3. Press the run button
4. Enjoy :^)

## Credits
In this stage my game is heavily inspired by [RyiSnow](https://www.youtube.com/c/RyiSnow).
Other than that I am currently the only person working on the project.

### More Information
So as I said this is the first videogame I ever made and it is also the first real Java(And GitHUb) project.       
I learned the basics of Java from the [MOOC fi for Java programming](https://java-programming.mooc.fi).
